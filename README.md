# My Homebrew tap

This tap contains formulae for software I use but which does not have an official formula.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install nef10/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap nef10/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
