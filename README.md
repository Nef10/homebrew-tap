# My Homebrew tap

This tap contains formulae and casks for software I use but which does not have an official formula.

## Formula list:

* [swift-test-coverage](https://github.com/Nef10/swift-test-coverage) - command line tool to display the test coverage of a swift package

## Cask list:

* [ControlRoom](https://github.com/twostraws/ControlRoom) - app that lets you control the simulators for iOS, tvOS, and watchOS
* [Domination](http://domination.sourceforge.net) - Risk game

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install nef10/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap nef10/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
